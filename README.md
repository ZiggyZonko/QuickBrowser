# 🛜 QuickBrowser 🛜



🖼️  || Background || 🖼️

After a long break, I finally thought of a feasible project to work towards, a simple yet efficient one-tab browser, solving the issue of clunky, slow, data-swallowing browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and of course, the infamous adware, Microsoft Edge. By using the PyQt5 Library, a Python UI library similar, yet more complex than tkinter, we can display the webpage using a simple, code-placed element.




⚙️  ||  Functionality  ||  ⚙️

Being a simple browser, not yet finished developing, the project must have some features, separating the QuickBrowser from the search engine-based browsers. One major feature implemented in the state-of-the-art QuickBrowser is the SearchSwitcher, a simple dropdown displaying all possible search engines that the browser allows for. We could include more in the future to gain an extensive level of functionality. More features are yet to be included, such as the built in proxy chain, locally hosted VPN (Virtual Private Network) and cookie logger with built-in packet manager, ensuring you understand what happens on your network.

Only using two libraries, ``PyQt5`` and ``qtaAwesome``, the library is extremely easy to set up and run. Depending on whether you decide to utilise the build version or the release, you will have significantly different experiences starting up and beginning to use. If you decide to take the release version ( That is the .exe file itself), you will not need to do much work except double-click to begin. On the other hand, when choosing the build version, you must install the sufficient dependencies utilised by this program. 

Firstly, you need a ``Python Interpreter > 3.9 `` and when selecting what to install in the wizard, click the ``install pip`` version, letting you download Python-compatible libraries from a command terminal. After installing Python and pip, you must install the dependencies. You must navigate to the directory where they are located and run this command

``pip install PyQt5 *`` to install PyQt5
``pip install qtaAwesome`` to install fontAwesome

Once completed, you'll be able to run the program by using your Python interpreter or running the Python script in the command terminal.
